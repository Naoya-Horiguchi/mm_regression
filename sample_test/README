Tips
====

If you know your testcase is only development version and never pass on
any current public trees, you can add TEST_FLAGS=devel flag on the testcase.
Then the test will not be run on normal 'make test' operation.
If you are working on developing kernel, you just enable 'devel' testcase,
by simply setting environment variable RUN_MODE like 'RUN_MODE=devel make
test'.
